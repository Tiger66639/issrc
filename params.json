Getting Started\r\n------------------\r\n\r\n- Obtaining sources\r\n\r\n  First you need to download the sources from Github. From the command line do:\r\n\r\n  ```\r\n  > git clone https://github.com/jrsoftware/issrc.git is\r\n  > cd is\r\n  > git submodule init\r\n  > git submodule update\r\n  ```\r\n\r\n  If you don't have the Git client (`git`), get it from:\r\n\r\n  http://git-scm.com/\r\n\r\n  To update your sources from the command line do:\r\n  ```\r\n  > git pull\r\n  > git submodule update\r\n  ```\r\n\r\n  To be able to contribute to Inno Setup, clone your own fork instead of\r\n  cloning the main Inno Setup repository, commit your work on topic branches\r\n  and make pull requests. See [CONTRIBUTING.md](CONTRIBUTING.md).\r\n\r\n- Install Borland Delphi\r\n\r\n  Unicode Inno Setup:\r\n\r\n  We compile all of Inno Setup's projects under Delphi 2009 with Update 3.\r\n  \r\n  Newer Delphi versions should also work but will lead to significantly larger\r\n  files.\r\n\r\n  Non Unicode Inno Setup:\r\n\r\n  We compile all of Inno Setup's projects under Delphi 2.01, with the\r\n  exception of Compil32 which is compiled under Delphi 3.02 (for the better\r\n  Far East character set support), and Inno Setup Preprocessor's ISPP which\r\n  is compiled under Delphi 7.\r\n\r\n  Delphi 2.01 is used for the main projects because its VCL has a significantly\r\n  smaller code size footprint than the later versions.\r\n\r\n  If you do not have access to these old versions of Delphi, you should be\r\n  able to compile the projects on later versions, however complete\r\n  compatibility is NOT guaranteed. We try to make Inno Setup compilable on\r\n  the later versions when possible, but do not have the resources to test\r\n  every change on every Delphi version.\r\n\r\n- Install Microsoft MSXML\r\n\r\n  Install Microsoft MSXML 4.0 SP2 if you haven't already done so.\r\n  See http://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=19662\r\n\r\n  If you are not sure whether you have MSXML 4.0 SP2 already, check for a\r\n  file named msxml4.dll in your Windows System directory with a version number\r\n  of 4.20.9818.0 (or later).\r\n\r\n  Note: Microsoft MSXML is only needed to be able to compile the help files.\r\n\r\n- Install Microsoft HTML Help Workshop\r\n\r\n  Install Microsoft HTML Help Workshop if you haven't already done so.\r\n  See http://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=21138\r\n\r\n  Note: Microsoft HTML Help Workshop is only needed to be able to compile the\r\n  help files.\r\n\r\n- Building\r\n\r\n  To build all files run **build.bat** and follow the instructions.\r\n\r\n  To just compile Inno Setup run **compile-unicode.bat** for Unicode Inno Setup\r\n  or **compile.bat** for Non Unicode Inno Setup and follow the instructions.\r\n\r\n  To just compile the Inno Setup help file and its web version run\r\n  **ishelp\\compile.bat** and follow the instructions.\r\n\r\n  To just compile the Inno Setup Preprocessor help file and its web version run\r\n  **Projects\\Ispp\\Help\\compile.bat** and follow the instructions.\r\n\r\n2. Delphi 2.0x users ONLY\r\n-------------------------\r\n\r\nBefore you can successfully compile the projects in Delphi 2.0, you must\r\ndo two things:\r\n\r\n- Install the latest version of SYSTEM.DCU if you haven't already done so.\r\n  It can be downloaded from Inprise's site at:\r\n\r\n  http://www.borland.com/devsupport/delphi/downloads/index.html\r\n\r\n  Look for \"System.zip\" in the \"Delphi 2 Items\" section.\r\n\r\n  If you do not do this, you will probably get an \"I/O Error\" message\r\n  when trying to run the projects.\r\n\r\n- If the files SHLOBJ.DCU and REGSTR.DCU are missing from your Delphi\\Lib\r\n  directory, download them here:\r\n\r\n  http://www.jrsoftware.org/files/delphi200units.zip\r\n    (md5sum: 94530f3c400c728df897d7d740889487)\r\n\r\n3. Component Installation\r\n-------------------------\r\n\r\nIf you intend to view or modify the Setup project's forms, you must install\r\nthe following component units, which can be found in the Components\r\ndirectory.\r\n\r\n- BidiCtrls\r\n- BitmapImage\r\n- FolderTreeView\r\n- NewCheckListBox\r\n- NewNotebookReg\r\n- NewProgressBar\r\n- NewStaticText\r\n- PasswordEdit\r\n- RichEditViewer\r\n\r\nIf you intend to view or modify the Compil32 project's forms, you must\r\nadditionally install the following components. (Like the Compil32 project\r\nitself, these require Delphi 3 or later.)\r\n\r\n- DropListBox\r\n- NewTabSet\r\n\r\nIf you only want to edit code, then you may skip installation of the\r\ncomponents, and choose \"Cancel\" if the Delphi IDE tells you a class can't\r\nbe found.\r\n\r\n4. Overview\r\n-----------\r\n\r\nInno Setup consists of seven projects:\r\n\r\n**Compil32** - This is the GUI front-end for the compiler. Compil32 does not\r\ndo the actual compilation itself; it relegates it to ISCmplr.dll. If the\r\nISCmplr project is changed, you normally don't need to recompile Compil32\r\nsince it's essentially a text editor, and is not affected by internal\r\nchanges to the compiler.  \r\nNon Unicode Inno Setup note: This is the only project that is compiled\r\nunder Delphi 3 (3.02 to be exact). The rest of the projects are compiled\r\nunder Delphi 2.01.\r\n\r\n**ISCC** - This is the command-line front-end to the compiler. Like\r\nCompil32, it depends on ISCmplr.dll to do the actual compiling.\r\n\r\n**ISCmplr** - This is a DLL which is loaded by Compil32 and ISCC to compile\r\nscripts. The actual compiler code is in Compile.pas. See CompInt.pas for the\r\nvarious structures and function declarations used to interface to the DLL.\r\n\r\n**Setup** - This is the actual \"Setup\" program. It displays the wizard, and\r\nperforms all (un)installation-related tasks.\r\n\r\n**SetupLdr** - This is the \"setup loader.\" It self-extracts a compressed\r\nSetup program into the user's TEMP directory and runs it from there. It also\r\ndisplays the \"This will install...\" and /HELP message boxes.\r\n\r\n**ISPP\\ISPP** - This is a DLL implementing Inno Setup's preprocessor interface\r\n\r\nHow do the projects link together?\r\n\r\n- ISCmplr, ISPP, Setup, and SetupLdr share the unit Struct.pas. This unit\r\n  contains various data structures and constants shared by the projects. If\r\n  Struct.pas is changed, you usually will need to recompile ISCmplr, ISPP,\r\n  Setup, and SetupLdr so that everything is in synch.\r\n\r\n- There are more units which are shared between projects. Search the 'uses'\r\n  clauses of the projects and units if you aren't sure if a project uses a\r\n  particular unit.\r\n\r\n- ISPP uses various copies of other Inno Setup files. To synch these\r\n  run synch-isfiles.bat.\r\n\r\n5. Source code tips\r\n-------------------\r\n\r\n- If you modify the Setup or SetupLdr projects and want to be able to compile\r\n  your installations with the new code, you'll need to copy the new EXE\r\n  file(s) to the Setup Compiler directory under the extension .E32.\r\n\r\n- When debugging the Setup project you should set UseSetupLdr=no in your\r\n  script, and copy the resulting setup-*.bin files to the source code\r\n  directory. This way you can simulate an actual installation while running\r\n  under the Delphi debugger.\r\n\r\n- All of the forms in the Setup project, with the exception of Main.dfm, have\r\n  Scaled set to False. This is because they dynamically scale themselves at\r\n  run-time by calling a function named SetFormFont.\r\n\r\n- When a Cardinal-type variable is compared against a constant expression,\r\n  why is a Cardinal cast sometimes used around the constant expression?\r\n  For example:\r\n\r\n  ```delphi\r\n  var\r\n      X: Cardinal;\r\n  begin\r\n      if X > Cardinal(1) then\r\n          ...\r\n  ```\r\n\r\n  The cast is needed to to work around a bug in Delphi 2 and 3 compilers:\r\n  without it, a *signed* comparison is done.\r\n\r\n- A note for those curious: The Setup Compiler creates single EXE Setups by\r\n  first creating the SETUP.EXE as usual, then concatenating the SETUP.0 and\r\n  SETUP-1.BIN to the end of the SETUP.EXE, and finally modifying an internal\r\n  data block in SETUP.EXE so it knows it's in \"single EXE\" form.\r\n\r\n- Starting with the 32-bit version of Inno Setup 1.12.7, the \"StripReloc\"\r\n  utility is used to decrease the size of the Non Unicode .EXE and .E32 files.\r\n\r\n  To download StripReloc, go to:\r\n  http://www.jrsoftware.org/striprlc.php\r\n\r\n- Delphi versions prior to 5 store .dfm files in a binary format. To be able to\r\n  track changes to the forms using ordinary \"diff\" commands, .dfm.txt \"mirrors\"\r\n  of the binary .dfm files have been created. Each time a .dfm file is\r\n  modified, dfm2text is ran and both the .dfm file and the updated .dfm.txt\r\n  file are commited.\r\n\r\n  To download dfm2text, go to:\r\n  http://www.jrsoftware.org/files/misc/dfm2text.zip\r\n\r\n- For compiler debugging purposes define ``STATICCOMPILER`` in CompForm.pas\r\n  and ``STATICPREPROC`` in Compile.pas. The latter requires Unicode Inno Setup.\r\n\r\n6. Precompiled executables and libraries\r\n----------------------------------------\r\n\r\nThe source code contains several precompiled executables and libaries:\r\n\r\n**Files\\isbunzip.dll**, **Files\\isbzip.dll** - Compiled by Visual Studio 2005\r\nfrom the bzlib directory in the Iscompress repository.\r\n\r\n**Files\\isunzlib.dll**, **Files\\iszlib.dll** - Compiled by Visual Studio 2005\r\nfrom the zlib-dll directory in the Iscompress repository.\r\n\r\n**Files\\islzma.dll**, **Files\\islzma32.exe**, **Files\\islzma64.exe** - Compiled\r\nby Visual Studio 2005 from the Projects\\lzma2\\Encoder directory.\r\n\r\n**Files\\isscint.dll** - Compiled by Visual Studio 2005 from Scintila 2.22 source\r\ncode with scintilla-2.22-patch.txt applied.\r\n\r\n**Projects\\_shfolder.res** - shfolder.dll from a fresh install of IE 5.5 SP2 on\r\nNT 4.0 stored in a compiled resource file.\r\n\r\n**Projects\\Helper\\x64\\Release\\Helper.exe**, **Projects\\HelperEXEs.res** -\r\nCompiled by Visual Studio 2005 from the Projects\\Helper directory and then\r\nstored in a compiled resource file.\r\n\r\n**Projects\\LzmaDecode\\LzmaDecodeInno.obj** - See Projects\\LzmaDecode\\compiling.txt.\r\n\r\n**Projects\\lzma2\\Decoder\\ISLzmaDec.obj**, **Projects\\lzma2\\Decoder\\ISLzma2Dec.obj** -\r\nSee Projects\\lzma2\\Decoder\\compiling.txt.\r\n\r\n**ishelp\\ISHelpGen\\ISHelpGen.exe** - See ishelp\\ISHelpGen\\compile.bat\r\n\r\n**Examples\\MyProg.exe**, **Examples\\MyProg-x64.exe** -\r\nCompiled by Visual Studio 2005 from the Examples\\MyProg directory.\r\n\r\n7. Inno Setup-specific editing guidelines for the help files\r\n------------------------------------------------------------\r\n\r\n- When mentioning something the user would type in a script, e.g. \"MinVersion\",\r\n  surround it by `<tt></tt>` so that it's displayed in the Courier New font. This is\r\n  a convention used throughout the help file. Example: `<tt>MinVersion</tt>`\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file! It's used internally to help with page regeneration."}
